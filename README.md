# My Thoughts

This article covers the rise of vibe-coding and many of the universal issues that accompany it across all different kinds of systems. I found it particularly interesting that the article implicates the marketing of AI tools, which often emphasizes speed and inadvertently pressures engineers to ship lower-quality products. As a result, teams may feel compelled to deliver faster simply because AI is involved. While AI excels at recognizing obvious patterns and accelerating repetitive or trivial tasks, problems arise when it is relied on for system design and architectural coherence. This highlights the importance of recognizing the limitations of AI, even as its adoption is increasingly pushed.

The way that vibe-coding focuses all on speed without accounting for future changes made me think of the stark contrast of this approach in comparison to how the scrum methodology accounts for both speed and future refactoring. The article emphasizes that months of relying on AI-generated features can introduce irreversible changes to a system that are a debugging nightmare and often also lead to security vulnerabilities. I think it is frustrating for many skilled engineers to see this push towards more speed without regard for overall system design and scalability.
